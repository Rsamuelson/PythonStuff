# Final Project

The final project will test not only your Python development skills but also your creativity, teamwork, business relevance, and skill at handling ambiguity. Therefore, there is much less guidance provided for this project than for any other assignment.

## Background

### Rationale

In industry, software development is always a team activity. The lone developer working by themselves and creating a great product is extremely rare; to design, build, test, and support a product of reasonable size requires multiple people working together, and in larger organizations, multiple teams in multiple departments work together.

When we instructors interact with industry leaders, we are often asked how much project experience we use in the classroom. Employees that have experience with project challenges of team organization, communication, and accountability are valuable to employers.

### Organization and Communication

Think about the roles that each of you will play in your group - this can help keep the group working well. If roles are clearly defined, this will allow for greater accountability and fewer problems. Don't assume someone will "just handle" a task -- make sure everyone understands who is expected to do what task. 

If a task isn't working out for someone, reach out for help to teammates and discuss. It can be difficult to admit a challenge, but it's much better to communicate and work it out, rather than dropping the ball, causing stress and disappointment.

## Guidelines

The project...
* must primarily in Python (SQL, HTML/CSS/Javascript "front-end" could be included in the project)
* use interfaces such as Web, GUI, "Chatbot" style (text interaction), or Jupyter Notebook.
* must provide business value (you'll be expected to articulate this in your presentations)
  * This could be a new service that a business could be built around (and thus be monetized in some way)
  * Or, it could be a system that would provides a tangible cost savings/efficiencies for a company.

## Deliverables

The final Project will consist of 4 deliverables.

### 1. Project Proposal (October 31 11:59pm). (10%)

Email the professor a brief introduction to your project idea (2-3 pages).

### 2. Design Document (November 6 11:59pm) (10%)

Email the professor a design document that elaborates on your project idea: It should define functionality, system design (define details such as data required, module structure that will be developed, libraries that will be used), and project structure (who does what).

### 3. Final Code/Product Delivery (December 9 11:59pm) (50%)

Submission of final working code and associated documentation. Completed code and documentation must be pushed to your team repo by the time & date due.

### 4. Final Presentations (Last Wednesday / Friday of Semester) (30%)

Presentations are expected to include:

1. Team and team member introduction
2. Business problem/opportunity
3. Steps/method you took/used to address the problem (this is where you discuss your project, data, coding, etc.)
4. Your solution (demo of the product)
5. The way forward/next steps

* Competitive Bonus (up to 20 additional points)

  * 1st = 20.0 points
  * 2nd = 15.0 points
  * 3rd = 10.0 points

The judge(s) for the final presentation will rank their preference for the presentations and projects. Judge(s) may only include the professor, but some number of other judges may attend (other faculty and/or business professionals).

NOTES:
* One or two class periods will be dedicated for you to work on your project and interact with the instructor to help solve any issues.
